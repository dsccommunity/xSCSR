Notes:

The samples require the use of [Windows Management Framework (WMF) 5.0 Preview](http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=398175).

All three examples use the exact same Configuration and just modify the behavior based on input ConfigurationData.

In the Examples folder you will see a version of each file with "-TP" appended to the name.
These are the equivalent examples for deployment of System Center Technical Preview on Windows Server Technical Preview.
